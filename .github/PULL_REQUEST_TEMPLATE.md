Thank you for wanting to contribute to Phalcon.

Before you submit a Pull Request, please bear in mind that PRs must be made on a
version branch (eg. `3.0.x`). `master` marks the latest stable release so PRs
targeting `master` will be **rejected**.

Please also make sure that the PR passes in Travis CI make the process more
efficient.

Please also only use tabs for indentation.
